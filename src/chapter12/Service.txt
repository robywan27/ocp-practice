a service is made up of an interface (service provider interface), any classes the interface references, and a way of looking up implementations of that interface (service locator)
    - service provider interface: specifies the interface (or abstract class) that defines the service
        - exports
    - service locator: can find the classes that implement the service provider interface
        - load() method from ServiceLoader class
            - convert to stream of the interface you are loading: .stream().map(Provider::get)
        - has uses directive (service provider interface) to look up a service
        - other directives: exports, requires (service provider interface)
    - consumer (client): module that obtains and uses a service (via service locator)
        - requires (service provider interface, service locator)
    - service provider: module that implements the service provider interface
        - provides directive: indicates that a module provides an implementation of a service
            - provides serviceInterface with implementationClass;
        - other directives: requires (service provider interface)
