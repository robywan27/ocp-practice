determining order of projects
    - draw a graph of the projects and their dependencies
    - projects with no dependencies are at the bottom
    - order is not always unique

bottom-up strategy - one by one starting from lowest level project: unnamed module on the classpath -> named module on the module path
    - start with lowest level projects
    - add a module-info.java to that project (add exports and requires directives)
    - move this named module from the classpath to the module path
    - ensure that any non-migrated projects stay as unnamed modules on the classpath
    - repeat for the next level of projects until all projects are migrated to named modules on the module path

top-down strategy - one by one starting from highest level project: automatic module on the module path -> named module
    - place all projects on the module path
    - pick the highest level project
    - add a module-info.java to that project to convert the automatic module into a named module (add exports and requires directives)
    - repeat for the next highest level project until you are done

cyclic dependencies (when two or more modules depend on each other) do not compile
