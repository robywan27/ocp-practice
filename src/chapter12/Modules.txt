    JPMS - Java Platform Module System

    module: one or more packages + module-info.java (module declaration)

    dependencies: one module relies on another module (arrow from dependent to dependency)

module-info.java
    - in the root of the module
    - contains module declaration
    - module name must not have dashes (usually includes periods; check automatic modules later for why)

directives
    - exports: makes a package accessible to other modules
        - export to a specific module: exports packageName to moduleName;
    - requires: specifies another module as dependency
        - transitive requires: requires transitive moduleName;
        - not allowed to repeat requires directive for the same module
    - opens: allows a package to be used with reflection
        - open to a specific module: opens packageName to moduleName;
    - uses: references a service
    - provides: makes a service available
        - syntax: provides serviceInterface with implementationClass;
