Terminology
    JAR - Java archive file

    JPMS - Java Platform Module System

    module: one or more packages + module-info.java (module declaration)

    dependencies: one module relies on another module (arrow from dependent to dependency)

module-info.java
    - in the root of the module
    - contains module declaration
    - module name must not have dashes (usually includes periods; check automatic modules later for why)

directives
    - exports: makes a package accessible to other modules
        - export to a specific module: exports packageName to moduleName;
    - requires: specifies another module as dependency
        - transitive requires: requires transitive moduleName;
            - e.g. animal <- dog <- puppy   - module dog must declare requires transitive; module puppy can just use requires dog or requires transitive
        - not allowed to repeat requires directive for the same module
    - opens: allows a package to be used with reflection
        - open to a specific module: opens packageName to moduleName;
    - uses: references a service
    - provides: makes a service available
        - syntax: provides serviceInterface with implementationClass;

types of modules
    - named module
        - contains module declaration (module-info.java)
        - appears on the module path instead of the classpath
    - automatic module
        - does not contain module-info.java
        - appears on the module path
        - it is a JAR placed on the module path
        - Java automatically determines the module name from the JAR file name (removing version numbers and dashes)
            - for example, my-library-1.0.jar becomes module name my.library
    - unnamed module
        - does not contain module-info.java
        - appears on the classpath
        - it is a regular JAR
        - can read from the module path and classpath, so can access all other modules; but not other way around (modules on the module path cannot access the unnamed module)
