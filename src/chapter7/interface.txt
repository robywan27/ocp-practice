implicit modifiers
    - interface is implicitly public
    - variables are implicitly public, static, and final (constants)
    - methods are implicitly abstract and public (unless private)
    - default methods are implicitly public
    - static methods are implicitly public

MUST
    - a concrete class implementing an interface must
        - provide concrete implementations for all abstract methods
            - in case of interfaces with same method signature (also for default methods)
                - it must provide one compatible implementation (e.g. with same or covariant return type)
        - define the overridden methods as public
    - default, static, and private methods must have a method body

CANNOT
    - an interface cannot be instantiated directly
    - invalid specifiers
        - an interface cannot be marked final
        - default methods cannot be final, abstract or static
        - static methods cannot be final or abstract
    - invalid modifiers
        - an interface cannot be protected or private
        - variables cannot be protected or private
        - methods cannot be protected
        - package visibility doesn't ever apply (because of implicit modifiers)

CAN
    - an interface can be implemented by a class
    - a class (concrete or abstract) can implement multiple interfaces
    - an interface can extend multiple interfaces

special syntax
    - default methods
        access method from (one of) the interfaces: InterfaceName.super.methodName()
    - static methods
        access method from interface: InterfaceName.methodName()
