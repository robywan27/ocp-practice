class that restricts which classes may extend it

keywords:
    - parent class/interface: permits + list of extending/implementing classes
    - subclasses/interfaces
        - final: can't be further extended
        - sealed: same rules as parent sealed class
        - non-sealed: can be extended by any (unknown) class

MUST
    - a sealed class must
        - be declared in the same package (or named module) as its direct subclasses
        - must list all direct subclasses in its permits clause (except when conditions below apply)
    - subclasses must
        - each extend the sealed class

CANNOT
    - a sealed class cannot list indirect (more than one level of inheritance) classes in its permits clause
    - an interface that extends another interface cannot be final (interfaces are implicitly abstract)

CAN
    - a sealed class can
        - omit permits if
            - all subclasses are defined in the same file
            - subclasses are nested
        - be declared abstract
    - a sealed interface permits keyword + implementing classes and extending interfaces
    - in a switch statement/expression
        - can omit the default branch when all permitted subclasses are covered and parent class is abstract

special syntax
    - permits in nested subclasses
        - must be prefixed with the name of the enclosing sealed class: EnclosingSealedClassName.SubclassName
