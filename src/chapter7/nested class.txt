kinds
    - inner class: non-static type at member level
    - static nested class: static type at member level
    - local class: type defined within a method/constructor/block
    - anonymous class: unnamed type defined within an expression

implicit modifiers
    - a nested record is implicitly static

MUST
    - anonymous class
        - extend a class or implement an interface

CANNOT
    - local class
        - have an access modifier
    - anonymous class
        - both implement an interface and extend a class

CAN
    - inner class
        - be declared private, protected, package-private, or public
        - can extend another class or implement interfaces
        - be marked abstract or final
        - access instance members of the enclosing class directly
    - static nested class
        - be declared private, protected, package-private, or public
        - the enclosing class can refer to fields and methods of the static nested class directly, even private ones
    - local class
        - be declared final or abstract
        - include instance and static members
        - access instance members of the enclosing class directly
        - access only final or effectively final local variables
    - anonymous  class
        - access instance members of the enclosing class directly
        - access only final or effectively final local variables

special syntax
    - all nested classes:
        - refer to variable in enclosing scope: EnclosingClassName.this.memberName
    - inner class:
        - instantiate: EnclosingClassName.InnerClassName innerObject = enclosingObject.new InnerClassName();
        - reference members of the enclosing class: EnclosingClassName.this.memberName
    - anonymous class:
        - instantiate and define: new SuperClassOrInterface(constructorArgs) { // class body }
