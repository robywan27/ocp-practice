    Queue
    Deque

implementing classes
    ArrayDeque
    LinkedList

* - means can throw an exception

queue and deque methods
    add data (to back)
        *boolean add(E e)
        boolean offer(E e)

    read data (from front)
        *E element()
        E peek()

    get and remove data (from front)
        *E remove()
        E poll()

deque only methods
    add data
        to front
            *void addFirst(E e)
            boolean offerFirst(E e)
        to back
            *void addLast(E e)
            boolean offerLast(E e)

    read data
        from front
            *E getFirst()
            E peekFirst()
        from back
            *E getLast()
            E peekLast()

    get and remove data
        from front
            *E removeFirst()
            E pollFirst()
        from back
            *E removeLast()
            E pollLast()

    stack operations
        void push(E e) - add to front
        E pop() - get and remove from front
        E peek() - read from front
