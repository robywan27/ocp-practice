interfaces
    Comparable
    Comparator

Comparable
    public interface Comparable<T> {
        int compareTo(T other);
    }

    result:
        - 0 -> this object is equal to other
        - <0 -> this object is less than other
        - >0 -> this object is greater than other

    interface is meant to be implemented by class comparing

    natural ordering that uses compareTo() is consistent with equals() if and only if
        x.equals() == true whenever x.compareTo(y) == 0

Comparator
    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface Comparator<T> {
        int compare(T o1, T o2);
    }

    result:
        - 0 -> o1 is equal to o2
        - <0 -> o1 is less than o2
        - >0 -> o1 is greater than o2

    because it's a functional interface, it's common to declare it using a lambda

    helper static methods
        comparing(function)
        comparingInt(function)
        comparingLong(function)
        comparingDouble(function)
        naturalOrder()
        reverseOrder()

        methods that allow chaining methods
            reversed()
            thenComparing(function)
            thenComparingInt(function)
            thenComparingLong(function)
            thenComparingDouble(function)


sorting and searching
    Collections.sort(List) - uses natural ordering (compareTo())
    Collections.sort(Comparator)
    Collections.reverse(List)
    Collections.binarySearch(...) - requires a sorted collection
