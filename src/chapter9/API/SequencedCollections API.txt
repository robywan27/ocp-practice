interfaces
    SequencedCollection
        SequencedSet (extends SequencedCollection)
    SequencedMap

definition
    a sequenced collection is a collection in which the encounter order is well-defined
    encounter order means all the elements can be read in a repeatable way (elements are not required to be sorted)

note
    most of the collections are sequenced, except HashMap and HashSet

SequencedCollection (and SequencedSet) methods
    add data
        addFirst(E e)
        addLast(E e)

    read data
        getFirst()
        getLast()

    remove data
        removeFirst()
        removeLast()

    reverse order
        reversed()

SequencedMap methods
    add data
        putFirst(K key, V value)
        putLast(K key, V value)

    read data
        firstEntry()
        lastEntry()

    remove data
        pollFirstEntry()
        pollLastEntry()

    reverse order
        reversed()
