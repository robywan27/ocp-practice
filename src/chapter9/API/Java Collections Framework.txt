Set: no duplicates, unordered collection
    HashSet: backed by a hash table (uses hashCode() method), fast operations, no order guarantee
    LinkedHashSet: maintains insertion order, can add/remove from front/back of set, can be slower than HashSet for random access
    TreeSet: sorted order, backed by a tree, accessing/adding an element could be slower than HashSet (as tree grows larger); null elements are not allowed

List: ordered collection of elements, allows duplicates, indexed access
    ArrayList: resizable array, fast random access, slow insertions/deletions -> good for when reading more often/same amount as writing to
    LinkedList: doubly linked list, fast access/insertions/deletions from beginning/end of list, slow random access (linear time)

Queue/Deque: orders elements in a specific way, typically FIFO; Deque (double-ended queue) allows access at both ends
    ArrayDeque: double-ended queue, resizable array implementation of a deque, fast operations
    LinkedList: double-ended queue, can also be used as a list, less efficient than ArrayDeque

Map: key-value pairs, no duplicate keys
    HashMap: backed by a hash table, fast operations, no order guarantee
    LinkedHashMap: maintains insertion order, can add/remove from front/back of map, can be slower than HashMap for random access
    TreeMap: sorted order of keys, backed by a tree, accessing/adding an element could be slower than HashMap (as tree grows larger); null keys are not allowed

(new starting from Java 21) Sequence: maintains the order of elements, allows duplicates
    SequencedSet: maintains insertion order, no duplicates
    SequencedCollection: maintains insertion order, allows duplicates
    SequencedMap: maintains insertion order of keys, no duplicate keys
