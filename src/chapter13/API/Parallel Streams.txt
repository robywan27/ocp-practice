- parallel stream: capable of processing results concurrently using multiple threads
- serial stream: processes the results in order, with one being processed at a time

create an instance
    - from an existing serial stream: collection.stream().parallel()
    - from a Java collection: collection.parallelStream()

parallel decomposition: process of taking a task, breaking it into smaller pieces that can be performed concurrently, and reassembling the results

ordering results (in the order in which they are defined in the stream): forEachOrdered()

parallel reduction: reduction operation applied to a parallel stream
    - performing order-based tasks: findFirst(), limit(), skip()
       order is preserved but less performance; consistent results with serial stream
    - combining results
        - reduce()
            - to guarantee order: accumulator and combiner should produce the same result regardless of the order they are called in
        - collect()
            - Collector class defines a characteristics() method that returns a set of Collector.Characteristics attributes
                - requirements for parallel reduction
                    - stream is parallel
                    - parameter of collect() has Characteristics.CONCURRENT characteristic
                    - either stream is unordered or collector has Characteristics.UNORDERED characteristic
                - static methods to retrieve collectors
                    toConcurrentMap()
                    groupingByConcurrent()

avoid stateful lambda expressions in concurrent streams!

generate random numbers: ThreadLocalRandom class
    get an instance
        ThreadLocalRandom.current()

    methods for working with ints (and similar others for doubles and longs)
        ints()
        ints(lowestInclusive, highestExclusive)
        ints(numberIntsToInclude)
        ints(numberIntsToInclude, lowestInclusive, highestExclusive)
        nextInt(highestExclusive)
        nextInt(lowestInclusive, highestExclusive)
