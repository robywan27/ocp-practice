Terminology
    - thread: smallest unit of execution that can be scheduled by an operating system
        - platform thread: thread provided by the underlying operating system - not efficient, useful mostly for CPU-intensive tasks
            - carrier thread: platform thread that runs virtual threads (when they are not blocked)
                - virtual thread: lightweight thread that is mapped to a carrier thread when needed to run; not tied to a OS thread - very efficient, useful for I/O-intensive tasks
        - system thread: thread created by the JVM  that runs in the background of the app, such as the garbage collector
        - user-defined thread: thread created by the app to perform tasks, such as the main thread
            - if it's of type platform, it's not a daemon thread (unless explicitly defined as such)
        - daemon thread: thread that runs in the background and does not prevent the JVM from exiting when the program finishes
            - virtual threads are always daemon threads
            - system threads such as garbage collection
            - platform threads when defined as daemon threads
        - thread priority: a numerical value associated with a thread that the scheduler uses to determine which thread to run
            - goes from 1 (Thread.MIN_PRIORITY) to 10 (Thread.MAX_PRIORITY), with a default value of 5 (for virtual threads it is not possible to change it)
    - process: a program in execution; group of associated threads that execute in the same shared environment
        - shared environment: threads share the same memory space and can communicate directly with each other
        - single-threaded process: process with only one thread
        - multi-threaded process: process with more than one thread
    - task : a unit of work that can be executed by a thread
    - concurrency: the ability of a system to execute multiple threads and processes simultaneously
    - thread scheduler: determines which thread should be currently executing (e.g. round-robin)
    - context switch: the process of saving the state of a currently running thread and restoring the state of another thread to allow it to run
    - asynchronous: thread executing main() doesn't wait for the completion of other threads; threads run independently of each other
    - synchronous: thread executing main() waits (blocks) for the completion of other threads

task representation
    - Runnable
        @FunctionalInterface
        public interface Runnable {
            void run();
        }
    - Callable
        @FunctionalInterface
        public interface Callable<V> {
            V call() throws Exception;
        }

create and start a thread
    factory methods - return builder object (recommended for Java 21+)
        - platform threads
            Thread.ofPlatform().start(runnable)
        - virtual threads
            Thread.ofVirtual().start(runnable)
        - additional methods on builder
            priority(int priority)
            daemon(boolean on)
            unstarted(runnable)
    constructor
        new Thread(runnable).start()

other methods
    - join() - tells main() to wait for the completion of the thread before proceeding
    - run() - executes the task in the current thread; does not create a new thread

thread lifecycle
    NEW -> start() -> RUNNABLE  -> run() and completes/exception thrown -> TERMINATED
        RUNNABLE -> resource requested -> BLOCKED -> resource acquired -> RUNNABLE
        RUNNABLE -> wait() -> WAITING -> notify() or interrupt() -> RUNNABLE
        RUNNABLE -> sleep() -> TIMED_WAITING -> sleep time elapses or interrupt() -> RUNNABLE

    can query state on thread object: getState() -> Thread.State enum

    exceptions
        InterruptedException
        IllegalThreadStateException
