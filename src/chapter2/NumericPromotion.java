/*Numeric promotion rules:
*   1. if two values have two different types, Java automatically promotes one of the values to the larger of the two
*  data types
*   2. if one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, the integral value is automatically promoted
*  to floating-point
*   3. smaller data types than int (byte, short, char) are promoted to int any time they are used with a binary
* arithmetic operator wit ha variable (as opposed to a value)
*   4. after promotion has occurred and all operands have the same data type, the result has the same type as its
* promoted operands
