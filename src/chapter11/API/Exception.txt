classes
    Throwable
        Exception - checked exceptions (must be handled with try-catch or declared in method signature with throws)
            RuntimeException - unchecked exceptions (do not need to be handled or declared, but can be caught if desired)
                ArithmeticException - / number by 0
                ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - access array with invalid index
                NullPointerException - access a null reference
                ClassCastException - cast to invalid type
                IllegalArgumentException - invalid argument passed to a method
                    NumberFormatException - invalid string passed to a method that expects a number
            IOException - input/output error
                FileNotFoundException - file not found
                NotSerializableException - object cannot be serialized/deserialized
            ParseException - error parsing a string
        Error - unchecked exceptions (fatal errors, don't handle and don't catch)
            ExceptionInInitializerError - error during static initialization
            StackOverflowError - stack overflow (e.g. infinite recursion)
            NoClassDefFoundError - class not found at runtime

throwing an exception
    throw new ExceptionType("message"); // creates a new instance of the exception and throws it

declaring exceptions in method signature
    void method() throws ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2, ... {
        // code that may throw the declared exceptions
    }

handling exceptions
    try-catch-finally block
        try {
            // code that may throw an exception
        }
        catch (ExceptionType1 | ExceptionType3 e) { // ExceptionType3 not allowed to be subclass of ExceptionType1
            // handle exception of type ExceptionType1 or ExceptionType3
        }
        catch (ExceptionType2 e) { // ExceptionType2 not allowed to be subclass of ExceptionType1
            // handle exception of type ExceptionType2
        }
        finally { // if present it is always executed; if present catch clauses are optional
            // code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught
        }

    try-with-resources block (for AutoCloseable resources)
        final var resource3 = new ResourceType3();              // must be final or effectively final
        try (ResourceType1 resource1 = new ResourceType1();     // delimited by ; its own statement
             var resource2 = new ResourceType2();               // resources are closed in the reverse order of their declaration
             resource3 /* optional ; */) {                      // automatically calls resource.close() at the end of the block, even if an exception is thrown
            // code that uses the resource
        }                                                       // implicit finally always executed to close the resource before the catch block and finally blocks are executed
        catch (ExceptionType e) {
            // optional
        }
        finally {
            // optional
        }

suppressed exceptions
    - exceptions that are thrown while closing a resource in a try-with-resources block, but are not the primary exception that caused the block to exit
    - can be accessed using Throwable.getSuppressed() method on the primary exception
