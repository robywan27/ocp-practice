initialization
    int[] numbers = new int[10]; // defines type and size; all values are initialized to their default value
    int[] numbers = new int[] {1, 3, 5}; // initialize the array with values; cannot increase the size of the array
    int[] numbers = {1, 3, 5}; // anonymous array
    int numbers[] = {1, 3, 5}; // [] can go here too; whitespaces don't matter

    int[] ids, types; // declare two arrays of int
    int ids[], types; // declare ids as array and types as int

    public int count(int... a) {...} // varargs; only with method params

    multidimensional arrays
        String[][] rectangle = new String[3][2];
        String[] rectangle[] = {{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6};
        String asymmetric[][] = {{1,2,3}, {4}, {5,6}};

equality
    arr1.equals(arr2); // reference equality, same as arr1 == arr2

length
    arr.length // it's a property! Not a method, so no ()

public STATIC methods from java.util.Arrays (it provides multiple overloaded implementations of a method for different types such as int, long, ... so we refer below generically to <type> for type parameter)
    toString(<type>[] a)

    sort(<type>[] a)
        note
            sorts in ascending order
            sorts Strings in alphabetic order (numbers, uppercase, lowercase)

    binarySearch(<type>[] a, <type> key)
        note:
            - sorted array
                - target found: return index of match
                - target not found: return -1 -(index where key would be inserted)
            - unsorted array: return undefined value

    equals(<type>[] a, <type>[] b)
        note: checks if arrays have same size and contain the same elements

    compare(<type>[] a, <type>[] b)
        note:
            - n = 0: same length and same values
            - n < 0: same elements but second array is longer OR first element that differs is smaller in first array
            - n > 0: same elements but first array is longer OR first element that differs is smaller in second array
            null is smaller than any other value

    mismatch(<type>[] a, <type>[] b)
        note:
            - -1: if arrays are equal
            - n >= 0: return first index where they differ
